		<p align="left"><span class="image left"><img src="/images/hkn.png" alt="" /></span>
		Founded in 1904 by Maurice L. Carr at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, 
		Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) was originally established to help electrical engineering graduates 
		find employment and gain footholds in their careers.  Eta Kappa Nu is recognized around 
		the globe as the honor society that represents the highest values of the Electrical & 
		Computer Engineering profession.</p>
		<p align="left">
		The intention of the founding members of HKN was to recognize and prepare the future 
		leaders of the profession. The Greek letters ΗΚΝ were chosen from the first, fourth, 
		and last letter of the Greek word for electron: ΗΛΕΚΤΡΟΝ. For more than 100 years, 
		HKN has embraced excellence.</p>
		<p align="left">
		IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-HKN), the honor society of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and 
		Electronics Engineers), is dedicated to encouraging and recognizing individual excellence 
		in education and meritorious work, in professional practice, and in any of the areas within 
		the IEEE-designated fields of interest. The society will continue to reinvent itself to serve 
		its members and society.</p>
