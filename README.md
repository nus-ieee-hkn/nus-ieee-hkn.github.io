## Technical details

This repository contains the code for the NUS IEEE HKN website. It is currently hosted on GitHub pages. The website uses Jekyll which supports Liquid, a templating language that can load dynamic content. This allows for some neat features, such as layouts. [From the Liquid documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/):

> Layouts are templates that wrap around your content. They allow you to have the source code for your template in one place so you donâ€™t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page.

## Installation

To be able to test the site locally, Jekyll would have to be setup as per the instructions on [GitHub's own documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

1. [Follow the instructions to install Jekyll and its requirements here.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) Note that Jekyll is a Ruby gem and requires a Ruby installation.
1. Open up a terminal and install bundler, also a Ruby gem.
	```
	$ gem install bundler
	```
1. Install all the required gems.
	```
	$ bundle install
	```
1. Run the site locally.
	```
	$ bundle exec jekyll serve
	```
1. The terminal should show the following if the installation is correct.
	```
	    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  	  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
	```
1. Open up http://127.0.0.1:4000/ or http://localhost:4000/ on a browser to test the site.

## Usage

Take a look at the [Jekyll Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to see the different aspects that can be used. Notably, there is currently a single default layout `_layouts/default.html` which removes the need for repeating the header and footer in every new webpage.
